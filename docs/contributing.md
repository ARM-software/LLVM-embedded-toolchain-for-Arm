# Contribution Guide

*LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm* integrates
[llvm-project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project)
and [picolibc](https://github.com/picolibc/picolibc).
Contributions are welcome that improve the project in areas including but not
limited to:
* Integration of upstream components
* Packaging
* Testing of the above
* Documentation

Where an issue is encountered that originates within `llvm-project`
or `picolibc`, it is strongly preferred that the issue is reported
and addressed directly within that project.
This benefits all users of the upstream projects and makes it easier to
support *LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm* going forward.

For guidance on how to contribute to the upstream projects see:
* `llvm-project` [Contributing to LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/Contributing.html)
* `picolibc` GitHub 
[Pull requests documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)
