# Bare-metal sample without semihosting

This sample shows how to use
[QEMU Arm System emulator](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/target-arm.html)
without semihosting targeting the
[micro:bit board model](https://www.qemu.org/2019/05/22/microbit/).

_Note: The sample code hangs at the end of the execution in an infinite loop! Use ``Ctrl-a x`` to terminate._
