# User space semihosting sample

This sample shows how to use semihosting with
[QEMU User space emulator](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/user/main.html).

Note: QEMU User space emulator
[does not support](https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/user/main.html#supported-operating-systems)
Windows, so this sample can be compiled but cannot be run on Windows.
