# LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm

This repository contains build scripts and auxiliary material for building a
bare-metal LLVM based toolchain targeting Arm based on:
* clang + llvm
* lld
* libc++abi
* libc++
* compiler-rt
* picolibc (newlib in versions 14 and earlier)

## Goal

The goal is to provide an LLVM based bare-metal toolchain that can target the
Arm architecture family from Armv6-M and newer. The toolchain follows the ABI
for the Arm Architecture and attempts to provide typical features needed for
embedded and realtime operating systems.

## Supported architectures

- Armv6-M
- Armv7-M
- Armv7E-M
- Armv8-M Mainline
- Armv8.1-M Mainline
- Armv4T (experimental)
- Armv5TE (experimental)
- Armv6 (experimental, using the Armv5TE library variant)
- AArch64 armv8.0 (experimental)

## C++ support

C++ is partially supported with the use of libc++ and libc++abi from LLVM. Features
that are not supported include:
 - Exceptions
 - RTTI
 - Multithreading

## Components

The LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm relies on the following upstream components

Component  | Link
---------- | ------------------------------------
LLVM       | https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project
picolibc   | https://github.com/picolibc/picolibc

## License

Content of this repository is licensed under Apache-2.0. See
[LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt).

The resulting binaries are covered under their respective open source licenses,
see component links above.

## Host platforms

LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm is built and tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

The Windows version is built on Windows Server 2019 and lightly tested on Windows 10.

Building on macOS is functional for x86_64 and Apple Silicon.

[Binary packages](https://github.com/ARM-software/LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm/releases)
are provided for major LLVM releases for Linux and Windows.

## Getting started

Download a release of the toolchain for your platform from [Github
releases](https://github.com/ARM-software/LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm/releases)
and extract the archive into an arbitrary directory.

On Ubuntu 20.04 and later `libtinfo5` is required: `apt install libtinfo5`.
(This requirement will be removed in LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm 17.)

On macOS the toolchain binaries are quarantined by com.apple.quarantine. To
run the executables change directory to bin and run the following command to
remove the com.apple.quarantine:

```
find . -type f -perm +0111 | xargs xattr -d com.apple.quarantine
```

### Using the toolchain

> *Note:* If you are using the toolchain in a shared environment with untrusted input,
> make sure it is sufficiently sandboxed.

To use the toolchain, on the command line you need to provide the following options:
* The target triple.
* Disabling C++ exceptions and RTTI that are not supported by the standard library provided yet.
* The C runtime library: either `crt0` or `crt0-semihost`.
* The semihosting library, if using `crt0-semihost`.
* A [linker script](
  https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Scripts.html) specified with `-T`.
  Default `picolibcpp.ld` and `picolibc.ld` scripts are provided and can be used
  directly or included from a [custom linker script](
  https://github.com/picolibc/picolibc/blob/main/doc/linking.md#using-picolibcld).

For example:
```
$ PATH=<install-dir>/LLVMEmbeddedToolchainForArm-<revision>/bin:$PATH
$ clang \
--target=armv6m-none-eabi \
-fno-exceptions \
-fno-rtti \
-lcrt0-semihost \
-lsemihost \
-T picolibc.ld \
-o example example.c
```

`clang`'s multilib system will automatically select an appropriate set of
libraries based on your compile flags. `clang` will emit a warning if no
appropriate set of libraries can be found.

To display the directory selected by the multilib system, add the flag
`-print-multi-directory` to your `clang` command line options.

To display all available multilibs run `clang` with the flag `-print-multi-lib`
and a target triple like `--target=aarch64-none-elf` or `--target=arm-none-eabi`.

It's possible that `clang` will choose a set of libraries that are not the ones
you want to use. In this case you can bypass the multilib system by providing a
`--sysroot` option specifying the directory containing the `include` and `lib`
directories of the libraries you want to use. For example:

```
$ clang \
--sysroot=<install-dir>/LLVMEmbeddedToolchainForArm-<revision>/lib/clang-runtimes/arm-none-eabi/armv6m_soft_nofp \
--target=armv6m-none-eabi \
-fno-exceptions \
-fno-rtti \
-lcrt0-semihost \
-lsemihost \
-T picolibc.ld \
-o example example.c
```
