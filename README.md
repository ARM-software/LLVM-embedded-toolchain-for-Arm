# LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm

This repository contains build scripts and auxiliary material for building a
bare-metal LLVM based toolchain targeting Arm based on:
* clang + llvm
* lld
* libc++abi
* libc++
* compiler-rt
* picolibc (newlib in versions 14 and earlier)

## Goal

The goal is to provide an LLVM based bare-metal toolchain that can target the
Arm architecture family from Armv6-M and newer. The toolchain follows the ABI
for the Arm Architecture and attempts to provide typical features needed for
embedded and realtime operating systems.

## Supported architectures

- Armv6-M
- Armv7-M
- Armv7E-M
- Armv8-M Mainline
- Armv8.1-M Mainline
- Armv4T (experimental)
- Armv5TE (experimental)
- Armv6 (experimental, using the Armv5TE library variant)
- AArch64 armv8.0 (experimental)

## C++ support

C++ is partially supported with the use of libc++ and libc++abi from LLVM. Features
that are not supported include:
 - Exceptions
 - RTTI
 - Multithreading

## Components

The LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm relies on the following upstream components

Component  | Link

LLVM       | https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project
picolibc   | https://github.com/picolibc/picolibc

## License

The resulting binaries are covered under their respective open source licenses,
see component links above.

## Host platforms

LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm is built and tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

The Windows version is built on Windows Server 2019 and lightly tested on Windows 10.

Building on macOS is functional but experimental. Currently it is only lightly tested on
a Macbook Pro with M1 on macOS 12.3.1.

[Binary packages](https://github.com/ARM-software/LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm/releases)
are provided for major LLVM releases for Linux and Windows.

## Getting started

Download a release of the toolchain for your platform from [Github
releases](https://github.com/ARM-software/LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm/releases)
and extract the archive into an arbitrary directory.

### Using the toolchain

To use the toolchain, on the command line you need to provide:
* A [configuration file](
  https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#configuration-files) specified
  with `--config`.
* A [linker script](
  https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Scripts.html) specified with `-T`.
  Default `picolibcpp.ld` & `picolibc.ld` scripts are provided and can be used
  directly or included from a [custom linker script](
  https://github.com/picolibc/picolibc/blob/main/doc/linking.md#using-picolibcld).

For example:

```
$ PATH=<install-dir>/LLVMEmbeddedToolchainForArm-<revision>/bin:$PATH
$ clang --config armv6m_soft_nofp_semihost.cfg -T picolibc.ld -o example example.c
```

The available configuration files can be listed using:
```
$ ls <install-dir>/LLVMEmbeddedToolchainForArm-<revision>/bin/*.cfg
```

> *Note:* If you are using the toolchain in a shared environment with untrusted input,
> make sure it is sufficiently sandboxed.

### Using the toolchain without config files

Instead of using a config file you can provide a `--sysroot` option specifying
the directory containing the`include` and `lib` directories of the libraries
you want to use, in addition to various other required options:
* The target triple
* Disabling exceptions and RTTI
* The `crt0` library - either `crt0` or `crt0-semihost`
* The semihosting library, if desired.
 For example:

```
$ clang \
--sysroot=<install-dir>/LLVMEmbeddedToolchainForArm-<revision>/lib/clang-runtimes/arm-none-eabi/armv6m_soft_nofp \
--target=armv6m-none-eabi \
-fno-exceptions \
-fno-rtti \
-lcrt0-semihost \
-lsemihost \
-T picolibc.ld \
-o example example.c
```
