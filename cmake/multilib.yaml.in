# If you're reading this file under the name 'multilib.yaml.in' in the
# LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm source tree, then it's not valid
# YAML in its own right: it's a template that CMakeLists.txt will
# expand into a real 'multilib.yaml' containing a list of library
# variants and the flags that will select them.
#
# If you're reading it under the name 'multilib.yaml' in the build or
# install directory, then that substitution has been done.
#
# Comments in this file mostly make more sense from the
# multilib.yaml.in point of view.

MultilibVersion: '0.1'

# The list of library variants is substituted in by CMakeLists.txt, so
# that it can respect the LLVM_TOOLCHAIN_LIBRARY_VARIANTS setting and
# only include the set of libraries actually included in this build.

Variants:
@multilib_variants@

FlagMap:

# Map higher architecture versions to subsets of them, so that a
# compatible library can be found even for architectures we don't have
# specific variants for.

# v8-M Baseline is a superset of v6-M

# v8.2-M Mainline is a superset of v8.1-M Mainline, in both hard and
# soft float variants.
#
# Also, v8.1-M Mainline is also a superset of v8-M Mainline, which in
# turn is a superset of v7E-M, and then of plain v7-M. We have
# libraries for all those architecture versions, but not for every
# combination of them with FPUs, so in some cases it might be
# necessary to fall back to a lower architecture in order to provide
# the needed FPU support.

#
# We don't consider any hardware FP configuration to be compatible
# with mfpu=none. It would work in most cases to cross-call between
# code compiled for an FPU or no FPU, if you were using the soft float
# ABI. But it wouldn't work in all cases: setjmp needs to know whether
# to save FP registers in the jmp_buf, so a non-FPU-aware setjmp would
# not behave correctly if linked into an otherwise FPU-using
# application. Similarly for exception unwinding. So we don't permit
# selecting an mfpu=none library as a fallback for any hard-FP
# library.
