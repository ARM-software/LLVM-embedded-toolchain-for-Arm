# If you're reading this file under the name 'multilib.yaml.in' in the
# LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm source tree, then it's not valid
# YAML in its own right: it's a template that CMakeLists.txt will
# expand into a real 'multilib.yaml' containing a list of library
# variants and the flags that will select them.
#
# If you're reading it under the name 'multilib.yaml' in the build or
# install directory, then that substitution has been done.
#
# Comments in this file mostly make more sense from the
# multilib.yaml.in point of view.

MultilibVersion: '1.0'

# The list of library variants is substituted in by CMakeLists.txt, so
# that it can respect the LLVM_TOOLCHAIN_LIBRARY_VARIANTS setting and
# only include the set of libraries actually included in this build.

Variants:
@multilib_yaml_content@

Mappings:

# Map higher architecture versions to subsets of them, so that a
# compatible library can be found even for architectures we don't have
# specific variants for.

# v8-M Baseline is a superset of v6-M
- Match: --target=thumbv8m\.base-none-unknown-eabi
  Flags:
  - --target=thumbv6m-none-unknown-eabi

# v8.2-M Mainline is a superset of v8.1-M Mainline, in both hard and
# soft float variants.
#
# Also, v8.1-M Mainline is also a superset of v8-M Mainline, which in
# turn is a superset of v7E-M, and then of plain v7-M. We have
# libraries for all those architecture versions, but not for every
# combination of them with FPUs, so in some cases it might be
# necessary to fall back to a lower architecture in order to provide
# the needed FPU support.
